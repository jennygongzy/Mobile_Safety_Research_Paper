Create your own inmate and attempt to survive in a prison where every sentence is a "death" sentence! Rub shoulders with up to 100 fellow inmates in a sprawling jail of 12 unique areas, each filled with fully interactive furniture and props. Plus a life beyond the jail populated by real civilians, with wardens enforcing dozens of different laws to stop you from making a break for it.Each day, you will find your health and mental state slipping away. Both can be restored by sleeping - which is also a good way to pass time. You won't always be permitted to sleep, though, so consuming food and drink bridges the gap. These, along with many other activities such as reading or watching TV, can also help to improve your mental state. If you "lose your mind" you will break down and will temporarily lose control of your character (almost certainly getting into trouble!).Your character also has a set of attributes that you are challenged to improve:- STRENGTH indicates how much damage you can inflict or absorb. You can improve it by fighting or lifting weights.- AGILITY determines how fast you move. You can improve it by jogging in the yard or scoring baskets.- INTELLECT reflects your knowledge - including fighting skills such as counters. You can improve it by reading books.- REPUTATION is how much other prisoners respect you. It can be improved by accomplishing tasks or intimidating others.There are also opportunities to earn money - whether you work for it with a broom, trade items at a profit, or run with a gang. Having money increases your opportunities to grease the wheels and make your life inside easier.You may find that you need to go to the toilet from time to time, in which case you must race to the bathroom! Alternatively, you could find a toilet to sit on or grab some toilet paper to spare your blushes. Failing to do so will damage your reputation and mental state.I regret that there is more to this game than I could ever explain here, so I hope you enjoy figuring some things out for yourself.Upgrade to "VIP" to enjoy the full experience without ads - plus access to the editor that allows you to customize your character and every other.BASIC CONTROLS:(*Look out for tutorials within the actual game)The game uses buttons where letters like GTA represent what they do:G = Grapple / Throw weaponT = Taunt (interact with handheld props)A = Attack (on its own to kick, with a direction to punch)R = RunP = Pick-Up / DropOTHER CONTROLS- Press ATTACK and RUN together to launch a powerful attack.- Press any button with any direction (or none) in a grapple to trigger different moves.- Press RUN and PICK-UP together to set fire to a small object (which can then be used to set fire to a large object).- Touch the clock to pause the game and bring up options to exit.- Touch any speech bubble to speed through conversations.PERFORMANCE- If you find your device struggles to display lots of characters, considering keeping the "Population" option low.- "Speed Up Frame Rate" sleeping will require good performance at the default frame rate.- Head to the "Display" options to tone down other features.

SPECIAL AUTUMN SALE88% OFF(USD 7.99 -> USD 0.99)!!!The special moves passed down through the bloodlines of the great clans...Will they lead the nation to salvation or ruin...?Introducing a hardcore Japanese-style 2D RPG which got the first place in the Google Play Top New Paid Apps in Japan!StoryHoshu Washin is a nation ruled by four clans. Kenshiro, the ruler-in-waiting of the Totsuki clan, prefers to spend his time chasing skirts and abhors the training he's forced to endure on a daily basis. One day, the Totsuki clan is attacked by mysterious beings in Oni Masks. Kenshiro vows revenge and sets off on a journey to bring them to justice with his faithful retainer and friend, Tatsuto.Clan SpecialsPerforming actions like attacks and deployment changes in battle will allow you to accumulate ESP that can later be used to unleash powerful special moves known as Clan Specials.

The degree at which you boost a stat impacts the skills (Kiho) you'll ultimately learn, so it's wise to take a balanced approach to their distribution.Mandara and DeploymentThough the order of turns is ultimately decided by each character's speed, a character can be turned counterclockwise after performing an action in battle. You can also place Mandara, special panels that will allow you to boost your stats and/or abilities. Using Mandara and deployment changes effectively can often be the key to emerging victorious in battle.QuestsThere are a number people in need of your assistance in the Hoshu Washins many towns and villages.

A good school simulation with outstanding features. - OFSTEDSchool's IN for summer! The story goes that Hard Time's prison has closed down and re-opened as a high school, but the challenge to survive and thrive remains the same. Live every hour of every day in real-time - from getting out of bed in the morning to attending a timetable full of classes, as you explore a city filled with interactive props. Picking up knowledge from each class helps you answer real questions in 10 different subjects, as you work towards the grades you need to graduate. But with over 100 fellow students walking the halls, an equally important popularity contest decides whether your days are filled with fun or fear.Although the game is mostly free to play, you can upgrade to a "Private" education to remove ads and make the school your own - starting with a student of your own creation and saving your changes to all 10 classes as well as the teachers and civilians. Private students also benefit from a more continuous experience that never ends until you want it to. And unlike the sims with numerous micro purchases, just ONE small payment unlocks the whole game for life.BASIC CONTROLS:In-game tutorials explain in more depth, but the basic controls are as follows:A = Attack (on its own to aim low, with a direction to aim high)G = Grapple / Throw objectR = RunP = Pick-Up / Drop (with a direction to prioritize objects, without to prioritize furniture)T = Taunt (interact with props)OTHER CONTROLS- Press ATTACK and RUN together to launch a powerful attack.- Press any button with any direction (or none) in a grapple to trigger different moves (as in Wrestling Revolution).- Press RUN and PICK-UP together to set fire to a small object (which can then be used to set fire to a large object).- Touch the clock or health meter to pause the game for more options.- Tap the speech bubbles to speed through conversations.PERFORMANCE- If you find your device struggles to display lots of characters, considering keeping the "Population" option low.- "Speed Up Frame Rate" sleeping will require good performance, so consider leaving it on "Speed Up Clock".- Head to the "Display" options to tone down other features.To learn more about this and other games, join the debate at:www.facebook.com/MDickieFans@MDickieDotcom School's IN for summer!

The biggest 3D wrestling game on mobiles, now celebrating over 28 MILLION downloads! Look up "Weekend Warriors" for the new MMA spin-off.The Wrestling Revolution rumbles into the 3rd dimension, where it now features BOTH aspects of the business in ONE epic universe for the first time ever. A wrestling career challenges you to take shots in the ring, whereas a "booking" career allows you to call the shots backstage - promoting entertaining matches every week for ratings. Seeing each side of the curtain gives you an even better appreciation for the other, and ensures you'll never grow bored of wrestling again! Both modes are available to play for free, with the option to upgrade to enjoy the "Pro" experience with no ads or limitations.And if playing Pro isn't enough, a separate "Backstage Pass" allows you to play God by saving your changes to all 9 rosters before pitting your immortals against each other in dream matches of your own creation! With 4 pages of rules to mix & match - including up to 20 wrestlers in rings of any shape or size - the only limit is your imagination. You can also blow off steam with no pressure by revisiting the 8 weeks of supercards from the game's promotional tour. Not to mention the interactive training process that teaches you how to lock up in the first place.BASIC CONTROLSThe game features an interactive tutorial that you are advised to play through, but the basic controls are as follows:CURSORS = Movement (double-tap to dash)A = Attack (with a direction to aim high, without to aim low)G = GrappleR = RunP = Pick-Up / Drop (with a direction to throw)T = Taunt / Pin / Referee dutiesEYE = Change focus / Turn opponent aroundHEALTH METER = Switch characterCLOCK = Pause / Change camera angle* This game is also compatible with Android controllers such as NVidia Shield 2k or MOGA Pro ("B" Mode).PERFORMANCEAlthough every effort has been made to keep performance as high as possible, some devices may benefit from a visit to the Options menu to fine tune the display:- The number of characters is perhaps the biggest factor so consider turning off referees and setting a limit on the match size.- If you don't want to sacrifice numbers, you can sacrifice polygons instead and opt for "Basic" character models (no fingers).- The ropes are surprisingly demanding and you may squeeze in an extra character if you make them "Static".- Turning off shadows and reducing crowd sprites may also help.I regret that there's more to this game than I could ever fit in an app store description, so please consult the online guides for further reading:www.MDickie.com/guides/wr3d_booking.htmOr join the debate on social meda:www.facebook.com/MDickieFanswww.twitter.com/MDickieDotcom* Please note that Wrestling Revolution depicts a fictitious universe.

HATFALL is a high-energy game of skill and hat-wearing born from Zero Punctuation, the hit online video series from The Escapist, created by the man behind ZP, Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw.When Yahtzee finds that his hat has gone missing theres only one option: collect as many hats as you possibly can. Fortunately hats are falling from the sky for no adequately explored reason, ready to be caught by your head. Just make sure you avoid the anvils and refrigerators that are also falling from the sky for no adequately explored reason. And try not to get confused by all the people who look exactly like you trying to do the same thing. And watch out for the short-tempered wizard. In short, it's not as easy as it sounds. But to truly master the art of putting on hats, you must acquire them by any means necessary. Catch them, steal them, embezzle them, and if all else fails, seduce them.NOTE - Please be aware that due to hardware limitations Hatfall may not run well on lower end devices.
